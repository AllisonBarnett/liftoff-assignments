In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our app will allow users to record and rate their favorite coffee beverages from their local coffee shops. Things like ethical practices and fair trade will be taken into account and rewarded. 
I know we said a Yelp for coffee, but with posting pictures, it could be more like an Instagram for coffee. People can follow baristas, or local connoisseurs to find the best coffee drinks and shops. Maybe there's a way to integrate a bit of both.
